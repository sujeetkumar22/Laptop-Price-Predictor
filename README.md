# Laptop-Price-Predictor
The goal was to  develop a machine learning model  that predicts laptop prices accurately based on relevant attributes. 
Introduction: Provide background on the problem of laptop price estimation. 
Highlight the factors that can impact a laptop's price, such as hardware 
specifications, brand, age, and condition. Mention that as laptops vary significantly 
by configuration, predicting accurate prices is complex but crucial, especially for 
consumer guidance and remanufacturers. 
• Relevance: Emphasize the importance of this work in contexts like: 
o Consumer Buying Decisions: Many buyers need reliable pricing insights to 
make informed decisions, especially for refurbished or remanufactured 
devices. 
o E-waste Management and Sustainability: Correct pricing can extend 
product lifespan by promoting the resale of remanufactured laptops, 
reducing e-waste. 
• Objective of the Project: State the goal as developing a machine learning model 
that predicts laptop prices accurately based on relevant attributes.
